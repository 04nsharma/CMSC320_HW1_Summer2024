I am interested in taking CMSC320 as I want to explore all areas of computer
science in university before I decide which area I want to pursue. This course
offers a comprehensive introduction to essential concepts and techniques in
data science which are crucuial for tackling real world problems. By learning 
these skills I hope to integrate them in my own personal projects and maybe 
even pursue a career in data science in the future.
